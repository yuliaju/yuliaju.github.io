    <article>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>In the mid-20th century, Noam Chomsky wrote "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously" target="_blank">Colorless green ideas sleep furiously</a>" to highlight the difference between syntax and semantics - namely, that grammar doesn't imply meaning. I want to take that distinction one step further.</p>

                    <p>First, I'll need to define phatic: "a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phatic_expression" target="_blank">phatic expression</a> is one whose only function is to perform a social task, as opposed to conveying information." Almost without pause, the example "How are you?" pops into my head. Indeed, sometimes not even "meaning" (in a semantic sense) implies <i>meaning</i> (in a directly functional sense). What is the purpose of communication? Isn't its aim to convey ideas and feelings, forms of information in general? Certainly signaling, social and otherwise, has a place in this definition, but when conversations are unnecessarily saturated with indirect niceties and the pressures of political correctness, functional <i>meaning</i> gets demoted in priority.</p>

                    <p>So now we've seen that there are different forms of communication, which are categorized by the information they convey (e.g., phatic communication conveys social acknowledgment). As much as I hate to admit it, there's even a time/place for phatic conversation, but let's focus on communication as a way to convey non-social information. My argument is that when conversation is of this form, the participants should consciously further this purpose by using precise language<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Precision of language encompasses both information density and connotative specificity. The opposite of being information dense is being verbose. Thus, information density can be increased by reducing instances of filler words, eliminating functionless redundancies, sacrificing meaning for clarity (sometimes), etc. It might be tempting to use information density as a proxy for successful communication. I think this metric is flawed in the same way using <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html" target="_blank">lines of code to measure programmer productivity</a> is flawed.</p>

                    <p>Consider this example from "<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/4h/when_truth_isnt_enough/" target="_blank">When Truth Isn't Enough</a>:" "I have perseverance. You are stubborn. He is pig-headed." When approached from a purely information density perspective, all three variations are equally "successful" at communicating. This example (and Yvain's post itself, which I encourage you all to read) illustrates the additional necessity of connotative specificity in effective non-phatic communication.</p>

                    <p>But connotation is <i>difficult</i> precisely because it is nuanced. These nuances are why people use "plethora" when I would much prefer "excess;" why "deep" is used to describe conversations (despite my cringing); and why I feel hopelessly "love"-averse.</p>

                    <p>I don't know how to solve this problem, but while there is low-hanging fruit, we should at least consider picking it. Verbosity is an obvious enemy, connotative ambiguity less so, but an even greater enemy, more overt and pervasive than both, is <a href="http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/" target="_blank">obscurity itself</a>. And that's really what communication should focus on defeating.</p>

                            <sup>1</sup> I might sound like a broken record on the topic of action-goal alignment, but the problem is quite large in scope. Furthermore, not only might the underlying cause be obscured, but specific instances (like this one) might also be important to individually confront.
