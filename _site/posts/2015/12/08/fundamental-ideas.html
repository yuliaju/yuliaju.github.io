  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a> captures a core shortcoming of language, that “the structure of a language affects the ways in which its respective speakers conceptualize their world.” Consequently, connections between phenomena are easily precluded because we use language to describe those phenomena. That is, if we use two different words to describe two different ideas, then by default we conceptualize those two ideas as separate, even if they’re manifestations of the same fundamental idea.</p>

<p>Fundamental ideas are the bases of <a href="http://juliayu.me/2015/10/11/analogies.html">analogies</a>. They serve as high density encodings of concept clusters, which is really valuable because it’s difficult to think about ideas that don’t have names. Learning fundamental ideas is useful because they essentially allow you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80-20</a> learning—if you are able to recognize underlying similarities between concepts, then you’ll be able to make deep analogies between new and familiar ideas. Analogously, fundamental ideas aid in reducing new problems to solved/solvable problems. It’s also important to note that there is a subjective spectrum of “fundamentality,” so some fundamental ideas are better at facilitating analogizing than others.</p>

<p>Below are a few fundamental ideas that I commonly think in terms of, organized approximately by use (more to less frequent). The ideas are formatted similarly to dictionary definitions; they’ll include the word(s), my definition of the fundamental idea, associated affect tags, and sample uses. The examples should be the most useful part.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Gestalt, Emergence, Simpson’s Paradox</strong>  <br />
The idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts. Unexpected macroscopic behavior can arise from microscopic interactions.<br />
<em>Tags: distinctly blurred, perception, mindfulness, multithreaded</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>I gain much more enjoyment out of food and music when I am able to perceive their individual components. Focusing on doing this is an easy way for me to get more hedons.</li>
  <li>Mindfulness meditation can help you notice the differences between thoughts of the form “I am confused,” “I notice that I am confused,” and “I notice that there is some part of me that is confused.” It allows you to focus on/notice distinct threads (of perception and thought), which helps in clarifying thought and resolving conflict, among others.</li>
  <li>Distinguishing between the affect attached to a thing and the thing itself. For instance, I might attach negative affect to pop music, but I should realize that pop music in reality is different from my internal image of pop music. This is a convenient way to monitor and update stereotypes to make sure that they’re maximally effective.</li>
  <li>Biases and heuristics—the way we arrive at a solution is not the same as solution itself. The first derivative is not the same as the function. For instance, using rationality techniques might help us come up with solutions to our problems, but we should still also evaluate those solutions independently of those techniques. If I use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oEyvXQXdPDzu72Wv2j5bRfJbB7hV3zrjLMVR_T428oc/edit">Murphyjitsu</a> to come up with a plan of action that’s likely to be implemented, I should be sure to consider the plan’s other merits/weaknesses. Internalizing this makes us less susceptible to confirmation bias.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Affordance, Good UI, Systemization</strong>  <br />
When your natural reaction is compatible with reality, when thoughts/systems are conducive to actions, when life is optimized for convenience.<br />
<em>Tags: intuition, convenience, yumminess, optimized, alignment</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Following the signs in a well-designed airport and getting to your desired destination. Without thinking, pulling a pull door or pushing a push door.</li>
  <li>Regular prefixes/suffixes (e.g., fallible and infallible, not flammable and inflammable); regular verb conjugations (e.g., wait and waited, not sit and sat).</li>
  <li>Finding a workout partner to keep you going to the gym. Using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en">StayFocusd</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-news-feed/hjobfcedfgohjkaieocljfcppjbkglfd?hl=en">Kill News Feed</a> to minimize online distractions. Having an accountability partner, using <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a>, or being around similarly motivated people to keep you on top of your goals. This fundamental idea allows us to see that problem of systemization is fundamentally the same as the problem of good UI—both are about guiding someone (yourself or a user) into a correct set of default/intuitive actions.</li>
  <li>Removing mental blocks that prevent good habits (e.g., gaining a S1 understanding that communication is important allows you to develop good communication habits).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Frames, Affect, Connotation, Priming</strong><br />
A heuristic for heuristics; the choice of one set of system 1 heuristics over another. The lenses we use to think and interpret experiences.<br />
<em>Tags: context, valence, ethos/logos/pathos, urge propagation, tradeoffs</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Two frames for viewing procrastination: procrastinating as having free time in the present (privileging present you) vs. not procrastinating as making free time for the future (privileging future you). Taking on these lenses reduces the decision of whether or not to procrastinate to the problem of assigning preferences to present and future versions of yourself.</li>
  <li>Taking an Uber as saving time and gaining comfort vs. taking a subway as saving money.</li>
  <li>Cooperation vs. defection; growth mindset vs. fixed mindset; agency vs. impotence; dichotomy vs. spectrum.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Shibboleth, Schelling Point, Plausible Deniability</strong><br />
The second (implicit) layer of information transferred by communication (or lack of communication).<br />
<em>Tags: mutual understanding, information transfer, Aumann’s agreement theorem, rational agents</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Being able to explain an advanced concept simply is a good Shibboleth of deep understanding.</li>
  <li>We didn’t discuss which side of the student center to meet at before an event, but we all independently went to the side closest to where the event was taking place. Consciously considering various degrees of communication allows for more <a href="http://juliayu.me/2015/08/22/precision-of-language.html">precise language</a>.</li>
  <li>For effective communication, your implicit and explicit messages should be aligned. For instance, your body language/tone should be aligned with the content of your message.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>80-20 Rule (Pareto Principle), Proxy</strong> <br />
Putting in less effort to get a “good enough” result. Finding potential arbitrages in your life.<br />
<em>Tags: hacking, goal factoring, efficiency, fungibility</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>If it takes about 3 h of work/week to get a B in a class and 15 h of work/week to get an A, and I care about passing, then I can 80-20 the class by aiming to work 3 h/week. Internalizing this fundamental idea encourages the frames of optimizing and action-goal aligning.</li>
  <li>If you believe that inside jokes are a proxy for closeness in a friendship, and you value closeness, then you can 80-20 social encounters by maximizing the number of chances for inside jokes (and the situations that create them).</li>
  <li>If typing speed is a bottleneck for you in many tasks (writing emails, writing code, writing blog posts, etc.), improving your typing speed and/or getting a new keyboard are efficient ways to hack your productivity. Alternatively, you could come up with better encoding schemes or learn keyboard shortcuts to solve the same problem.</li>
</ol>
