_What I've been reading this month:_

*   A [great post](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410) by Scott Aaronson on plausible deniability and Aumann's agreement theorem. Related: a [short story](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/15/it-was-you-who-made-my-blue-eyes-blue/) by Scott Alexander on the blue eyes riddle.
*   [Research on incompetence](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/may/04/research.highereducation): "The incompetent don't perform up to speed; don't recognise their lack of competence; and don't even recognise the competence of other people."
*   [Quantifying fluid intelligence](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/scientists-can-now-predict-intelligence-brain-activity/) using MRI.
*   Case study on [architecture and social development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruitt%E2%80%93Igoe) in mid-20th century St. Louis.
*   Insights into [pick-up artistry/texting](http://texting.tips/)
*   Advances in camera tech, the "first [multi-aperture computational camera](http://m.phys.org/news/2015-10-multi-aperture-camera.html)."
*   So fascinating to read about drastically different lifestyles—in this case, those of [super rich Chinese children](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-10-01/children-of-the-yuan-percent-everyone-hates-china-s-rich-kids).
*   A [social credit score](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2015/10/in-china-your-credit-score-is-now-affected-by-your-political-opinions-and-your-friends-political-opinions/) for political alignment in China; apparently this will become mandatory in 2020.
*   Interview with the founder of Coursera on [learning, personal missions, automation, and other interesting topics](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/05/13/andrew-ng_n_7267682.html).
*   So awesome—"a [low-cost smartphone accessory](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150204144517.htm) that…simultaneously detects three infectious disease markers—HIV and syphilis—from a finger prick of blood in just 15 minutes."

_Other things I've been enjoying:_

*   [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix)—I might be the last person interested in AI to watch this. I don't have too much to say, but I did enjoy it (despite being extremely confused when Trinity revived Neo with a kiss). And now I'll be able to understand references to/memes of the movie.
*   For anyone interested in rationality, Julia Galef makes some really great and accessible [videos on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz-RZblnhjXK_krP1jDybeQ).
*   If you can beat my high score (659) on this [terrible flash game](http://stuffucanuse.com/online_game/man-chases-cursor/man-chases-cursor.html), congratulations.
