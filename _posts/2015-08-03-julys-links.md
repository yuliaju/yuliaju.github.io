_What I've been reading<sup>1</sup>:_

*   Aaron Swartz's series on [personal growth, setting goals, biases, and more](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve).
*   I found [this Aeon essay](http://aeon.co/magazine/psychology/mary-hk-choi-my-foreign-mom/) on having an Asian mom to be simultaneously disgusting and relatable—an addicting read.
*   Inside look at North Korea, from the perspective of [Kim Jong-il's sushi chef](http://www.gq.com/story/kim-jong-il-sushi-chef-kenji-fujimoto-adam-johnson).
*   The Bauhaus advertised their first exhibition (and aesthetic) using [postcards](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/perfect-medium-bauhaus-artists-postcards/)! Includes postcards by Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and others.
*   The [next University of Phoenix](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/a-college-without-classes/400115/?single_page=true)? "[C]ompetency-based education" — online accreditation that's time-flexible and test-based<sup>2</sup>.
*   An [interview with Manjul Bhargava](http://www.t5eiitm.org/2015/07/forty-minutes-with-a-fields-medallist/)!
*   [Another story about twins swapped at birth](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota.html?_r=0#). A reminder of how much influence living conditions (location, income, etc.) have on available opportunities.
*   I kind of [want a bidet](http://magazine.good.is/features/why-wont-north-americans-use-bidets-toilet-paper-water-waste) now. And a [smart mattress cover](http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/17/luna-joins-y-combinator/).
*   After 6 years in jail, Iranian-Canadian blogger [Hossein Derakhshan writes on how the web has changed](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426).

_Other things I've been enjoying:_

*   Omg, [chai latte concentrate](http://www.amazon.com/Tazo-Chocolate-Chai-3-Packages/dp/B00FE6EJRA). Also, [Google Express](https://www.google.com/express/u/0/).
*   Mute ads on Spotify (for OS X users): [Spotifree](http://spotifree.gordinskiy.com/)
*   Track your time: [Toggl](https://toggl.com/)
*   Save Chrome tabs (I use this to easily open frequently read websites): [Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en)
*   Another Chrome extension—timed use of blocked sites (I use this to curb my bad YouTube habit): [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en)
*   "[Aleko: The Young Gypsy's Romance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh9vLmjap_s)" - Sergei Rachmaninoff

* * *

<sup>1</sup> Not _Infinite Jest_ (sorry, David Foster Wallace).  
<sup>2</sup> This makes me think of [Scott Young's MIT challenge](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/).
