When I started to code, the actual process of writing the code was effortful, and translating between my thoughts and the programming language was the bottleneck. It wasn't until after I had to code full-time that I was able to internalize this aspect of coding, after which the effortful step became effortless, as responsibility for handling it shifted from System 2 to System 1\. Internalizing the translation process freed up my attention so that I could think about optimizing for code quality and elegance. This led to beliefs about programming aesthetics that I couldn't have generated when writing the code was my primary concern.

This transition - from using System 2 to System 1 - is a general pattern that I've observed while learning. For instance, when I started doing improv comedy, coming up with my next line was the effortful task. Character and plot development, as well as thinking about higher level humor (like finding new [games](http://improvencyclopedia.org/glossary/Finding_the_Game.html)), were an afterthought. I had to internalize the basics before I was able to see a discrete improvement, or even have the attention to attempt such an improvement. Part of the reason for this is that attention and working memory are finite, so the only way to think more thoughts at once is to outsource some of those thoughts to System 1.

The vague feeling of hard things becoming easy, or foreign things becoming second-nature, is what I mean by "internalize." I wish I could use "intuitionizing," if that were actually a word; "leveling up" is also a related concept.

I think that internalization is a good way to model the learning process. It explains why "a ha" moments happen and why it can retrospectively feel like you should have been able to have certain updates earlier (e.g., realizing/propagating implications, improving a skill, etc.).
