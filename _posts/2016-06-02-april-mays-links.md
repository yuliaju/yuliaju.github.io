_Links:_

*   Food follows technology? Sonic creates [square shakes](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/sonic-making-awesome-square-shakes-designed-instagram-sold-through-instagram-170602) for Coachella, inspired by Instagram and sold exclusively on Instagram.
*   A [review](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/) of David Fischer's _Albion's Seed_. Super interesting explanation of how 17<sup>th</sup> century American colonists shaped modern day regional stereotypes.
*   Panama Papers whistleblower's [statement](https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html) calls for changes in democracy and capitalism, and shares a powerful message about censorship: "we live in a time of inexpensive, limitless digital storage and fast internet connections that transcend national boundariesâ€¦from start to finish, inception to global media distribution, the next revolution will be digitized. Or perhaps it has already begun."
*   Two great posts from Benedict Evans on history and technology. The [first](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/4/20/the-best-is-the-last) describes how "technology often produces its best results just when it's ready to be replaced," and the [second](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/5/2/inevitability-in-technology) gives examples of applying counterfactuals to technology.
*   ["LSD Saved My Marriage"](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/05/20/lsd-saved-marriage/)
*   The [story](http://priceonomics.com/the-man-who-got-no-whammies/) of how one crackpot noticed a pattern in the game show _Press Your Luck_ and used it to win $110,237 (in 1984).
*   Clear [definitions of arrogance and vanity](https://frankdevita.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/vanity-in-nietzsches-beyond-good-and-evil/), based on the distinction between noblemen and ordinary men in Nietzsche's _Beyond Good and Evil_. (H/t Sonia)
*   Free supercharging not included with Tesla's [Model 3](http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-model-3-chargers-20160601-snap-story.html), to lower costs.
