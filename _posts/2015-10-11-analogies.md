Analogies make the world a better place. Here are two (related) applications:

**Learning/Understanding**  
A good analogy expedites and facilitates the learning process. I think of learning/understanding as the 2-step process of acquiring knowledge and linking knowledge—adding nodes and (re)drawing edges in a graph, respectively. Analogies strengthen connections and build on previous mental models. Also, updating knowledge costs less mentally than starting to learn from scratch; it's easier to add onto an existing framework than to build the framework itself.

**Communication**  
Analogies are kind of like symbols. A symbol is something that maps to an idea. An analogy is an idea that maps to another idea, or a type of logic that maps to another type of logic. Analogies are a common language; they help reduce [inferential distance](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance). For instance, if<sup>1</sup> I know thermodynamics and Michael knows [thermodynamics and information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory), he can explain information-theoretic entropy to me in the language of thermodynamic entropy.

<sup>1</sup> This is _totally_ hypothetical.
