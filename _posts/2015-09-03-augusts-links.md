_What I've been reading this month:_

*   Damn, [CRISPR/Cas9](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/crispr-dna-editing-2/) is so cool; here's one [application](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/pathway-controls-metabolism-underlying-obesity-0819) for obesity.
*   "[[H]ydrogen sulfide](http://gizmodo.com/holy-grail-of-superconductors-could-revolutionize-ele-1724817434) is the highest-temperature superconductor known to man, besting the previous record-holder by about 40 ºC." Woo, superconductors!
*   Inequality is always frustrating, especially when the juxtaposition is [this obvious](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/14/hamptons-super-rich-inequality).
*   Example of the "[people don't have consistent beliefs](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kk/why_are_individual_iq_differences_ok/)" phenomenon.
*   I don't usually read The Onion, but [this pigeon quiz](http://www.clickhole.com/quiz/can-you-match-pigeons-way-theyre-ruining-my-whole--2899) really cracked me up.
*   [Vertical is the new horizontal](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/technology/personaltech/vertical-video-on-the-small-screen-not-a-crime.html)—paradigm shift courtesy of Snapchat.
*   Ben Evans classifies the Apple Watch as a "[useful luxury product](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/8/2/notes-on-apple-watch-and-friction)," which is an appropriate/better way to think about smartwatches and related gizmos.
*   Links for all my water snobs: why [water tastes weird](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/big-question-tap-water-go-stale-overnight/) after it's been left out; [water tasting menus](http://www.eater.com/2013/8/6/6390275/la-restaurant-has-45-page-water-menu-water-sommelier) are the next.
*   [Kik](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9def9c78-45d6-11e5-b3b2-1672f710807b.html) / [VurbChat](http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/20/vurbchat/) as the next WeChat? (Andreessen Horowitz on the [significance of WeChat](http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/).)
*   [Try clothes on virtually](http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/19/memomis-memorymirror-lets-you-try-on-clothes-without-actually-putting-them-on/)!
*   Research on [combating antibiotic resistance](http://phys.org/news/2015-08-team-mutations-bacteria-resist-antibiotics.html) (one of my biggest fears).
*   Live a meaningful life by [repaying your debt](http://www.nancyhua.com/2013/12/23/waste-life/) to everyone.
*   [_Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future_](http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233) (Ashlee Vance) was a good read. Writing was almost distractingly bad in many places, but the content was entertaining, inspiring, and hope-inducing. Would recommend to people interested in Elon Musk and his vision of the future.

_What I've been watching this month:_

*   [Straight Outta Compton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Outta_Compton_(2015_film)) - I really enjoyed this movie, despite not expecting to. Thoroughly entertaining, great music, socially relevant. It helped me internalize certain behaviors that I've never experienced (e.g., racial profiling).
*   [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spZduSScDW0) - I strongly recommend this documentary to anyone who cares about internet rights/privacy or is/has been moved by Aaron Swartz. Extremely inspiring, despite being a little one-dimensional. Spoiler: the [ending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Andraka) was so weird.
*   [The Take (2004)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sug7bWxTuSo) - Didn't enjoy this documentary too much, but others might find it thought-provoking (Michael did).
*   Addicting waste of time for the month: [popin cooking videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/RRcherrypie/featured).

_Other things I've been enjoying:_

*   [InspiroBot](http://inspirobot.me/): "an artificial intelligence dedicated to generating unlimited amounts of unique inspirational quotes for endless enrichment of pointless human existence."
*   [Hackathon aesthetic generator](http://qrohlf.com/trianglify-generator/)
*   Can't believe I just discovered [Sporcle](http://www.sporcle.com/). It's addicting but not very productive—try at your own risk.
