_Articles:_

*   A [look](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/business/international/china-disney.html) into the history of Disney's partnership with China's Communist Party and the negotiations that went into the Shanghai Disney Resort that opened in June 2016.
*   Olympic [triathlete uses VR](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/for-the-olympian-gwen-jorgensen-the-triathlon-is-a-mental-race/) for mental training (and wins gold in Rio).
*   Good (and inspiring) descriptions of what [desperation](http://mindingourway.com/desperation/) feels like and the stigmas associated with caring hard.
*   My favorite read of the entire summer: a [Scientific American interview with Scott Aaronson](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/). Goes into quantum computing, P vs. NP, his idea of a utopia, and more.
*   [Criticism of "radical leftist, anti-oppressive politics"](http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/11/everything-problematic/) from a former student activist at McGill. Aligns with my feelings on SJWs.
*   An [explanation](https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2016/06/26/are-you-missing-universal-human-skills/) of why you might be missing some common human skills.
*   Two ways to think about history and progress: [Whig and Han](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/whig-vs-haan.html).
*   A [touching article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/magazine/my-father-the-youtube-star.html) about how food and cooking videos on YouTube improved a father-son relationship.

_Miscellaneous:_

*   [Ex Machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)) - [AI-Box Experiment](http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox/) meets love story. Would recommend if you would like to be inspired to think more about (un)friendly AI.
*   [The Little Prince (2015 film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince_(2015_film)) - Disclaimer: I've never read the corresponding book. However, I would strongly recommend this movie to all my friends. It was great at triggering strong emotions.
*   [(My referral link to) Honey](https://joinhoney.com/ref/kxfcrt) - "a browser extension that automatically finds and applies coupon codes at checkout with a single click," an easy way to save money while shopping online.
*   A website full of restaurant critic [Andy Hayler's reviews](http://www.andyhayler.com/) of top restaurants. Interesting!
