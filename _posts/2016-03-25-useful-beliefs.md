_"All generalizations are dangerous, even this one."_ â€” Alexandre Dumas

Global policies are useful. By caching computations and forming habits, you can reduce attentional drains. For instance, choosing to wear the same thing everyday saves you the cognitive effort of always making that decision.

But caching decisions like this has an obvious flaw: adaptability is necessary! If you're attending a formal event, you should think twice before putting on your uniform of t-shirt and jeans. The same is true for the global policy of epistemic rationality. Always trying to update towards more accurate beliefs about the world is great in theory, but intentionally not doing so (i.e., self-delusion) is often useful in practice.

Examples: confidently flirting even if your prior probability of success is low; internalizing growth mindset even if you believe intelligence is fixed; acting as if the other party likes you in a sales meeting even if you've never met them before; rushing to catch the train even if Google Maps says you won't make it in time; not revealing your desperation in a job interview even if you've been unemployed for months.

There's a difference between true beliefs and useful beliefs, and from a utility-maximizing perspective, holding useful beliefs (regardless of their validity!) is preferable. This line of reasoning is also why I think being knowingly hypocritical can be beneficial.
