Blogger Hossein Derakhshan [noted](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426) that from 2008 to 2014, the web became more like TV: "linear, passive, programmed and inward-looking." He cites Instagram, an app that doesn't support hyperlinks<sup>1</sup>.

I've noticed a similarity in the Facebook mobile app. Although hyperlinks open, they do so internally by default (i.e., not in a browser)<sup>2</sup>. This obviously makes sense from the company's perspective, but that's only more evidence that we should question these default behaviors/use cases.

Let's reflect on other technologies, in transportation rather than information. Cars: they increased city sizes and made suburbia possible. They expanded our perception of the world; our definition of "close" changed from walking- to driving-distance. This paradigm shift was mirrored by the growing accessibility of commercial airplanes in the [mid-20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner).

Cars and airplanes broaden our world—the internet should as well. If something as simple as walking slowly in a city can narrow the world<sup>3</sup>, to what extent is inward-looking software detracting from the internet's potential?
