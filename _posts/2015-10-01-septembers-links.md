_What I've been reading this month:_

*   A [new restaurant](http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/31/eatsa/) experience. No lines, no cashiers, no (visible) workers. Another exciting aspect: rewards for returning customers.
*   A great [interview with philosopher Julian Savulescu](http://nautil.us/issue/28/2050/the-philosopher-who-says-we-should-play-god) on genetic engineering, cloning, and the future of humanity.
*   I might be too excited about this [plan to replace the Tube with moving sidewalks](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/real-plan-replace-londons-tube-moving-walkways/). (But it's so cool!!)
*   Predicting the relationship between [AI and genetic modification](http://nautil.us/issue/28/2050/dont-worry-smart-machines-will-take-us-with-them).
*   A look into the development of Apple's new [3D touch](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-how-apple-built-3d-touch-iphone-6s/) feature.
*   [A move in the right direction](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices)—Harvard "encouraged its faculty members to make their research freely available through open access journals and to resign from publications that keep articles behind paywalls."
*   Japan's education minister urges national universities to [abolish social sciences and humanities faculties](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/social-sciences-and-humanities-faculties-close-japan-after-ministerial-decree).
*   Insights on vegetarianism—[really helpful](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/23/vegetarianism-for-meat-eaters/) for people conflicted between the moral implications of eating meat and the difficulty of becoming a vegetarian.
*   A response to the [$750 Daraprim pill](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/21/a-750-pill-and-a-founder-who-doesnt-know-when-to-stop-tweeting/) that investigates the broader issue of [how drug monopolies are able to exist](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/24/the-problems-with-generic-medications-go-deeper-than-one-company/) in the first place.
*   Breaking news: [water on Mars](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/nasa-salty-liquid-water-on-mars/12)!
*   Edward [Snowden's take on the Fermi paradox](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/21/9363863/edward-snowden-alien-encryption).
*   Surprise upset at the US Open—[Serena Williams lost her chance at a Grand Slam](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2015/09/11/serena-williams-lost-her-way-mentally-tactically-us-open-tennis/72101826/) in the semifinals.
*   [RIP, Intel STS](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/technology/intel-to-end-sponsorship-of-science-talent-search.html).
*   "[B]ring[ing] the [stethoscope into the 21st century](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/bringing-the-stethoscope-into-the-smartphone-era/)."
*   "[Reasons To Be Cheerful](http://www.utilitarianism.com/greg-egan/Reasons-To-Be-Cheerful.pdf)" (Greg Egan)—A sci-fi short story that questions the importance of emotional autonomy in an engaging way. I was a little bit disappointed with the ending but otherwise really enjoyed the plot. Also, I get abnormally excited whenever I read something that has a character named Julia.<sup>1</sup>
*   [Zero to One](http://zerotoonebook.com/)<sup>2</sup> (Peter Thiel and Blake Masters)—Lots of interesting thoughts and succinct ways of communicating big ideas. Diverse range of evidence and anecdotes. I'll probably reread this someday soon.

_Miscellaneous:_

*   Did other people know that [pocket wifi](https://www.tepwireless.com/faq/) is a thing?
*   [PhotoFeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com/), a generalized Hot or Not.
*   I'm enrolled in an architecture class this semester. Here's [something beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Abu_Dhabi).
